# SchoolDbProject
A School project where we created a database in SQL server and used both ADO.NET and Entity Framework Core to communicate with the database.
You interact with the app with a keyboard through a menu!

## This is a Console Application
I will upload the sqlquery for the database later on so it can be used for testing!
Will update the readme when i do.
